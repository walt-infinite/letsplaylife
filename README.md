I'm currently exploring how I can use technology to transform my life experience into a videogame.
This has always been and will always be an open source project.

I've been toying with the idea of this project for years now.
Transforming my life into an actual video game.

You have no idea how far I've stretched that idea.
I've pushed it to the confines of the universe.
I've pushed it past space and time, to meet with the source of fundamental information.

I believe we, as developers, have a shot at transforming life so humanity can reconnect to Earth and its desire to evolve into something new.

We are World Wide Web Makers.

Never forget that.

Never forget why you came into code in the first place.
Not to make money, not to feed investors, not to become ego-jerks that seem to have come out of a dystopian comedy show.

We are on the brink of something new.
Something exciting.

Something that goes through your body and sings in your veins while you're typing words on your keyboard to build amazing technology and experiences.

I believe there has to be something that can be done by developers of the World to make sure we build a better future for everyone. 

It will be chaos.
But we have been the builders of the modern world for decades now.

Some of us have been enslaved by corporations.
Some found their way there.

But deep inside, the flame still shines.
You can feel it.

The call for the actual decentralized, open source action.

I believe there is only one catch with the open source community.
We have to stop fighting capitalism.

Let's turn it into a comodity.
Hack it from the inside out.
Make sure all our loved ones have enough money to eat, to be sheltered, and to build a happy home.

As human beings, I believe we have a fundamental right to abundance.
Abundance doesn't mean the same thing for all human beings, though.
Abundance is not wealth. Abundance is the feeling that you have just everything you want in life.

There are two ways to reach that state:
- falling in love with what you have
Pretty easy if you have a lot and are not living in constant need.
Otherwise, you don't have that luxury.

- moving towards getting what you want
For some, life has put you on a path where you just seem not to be able to do that.
You are depressed. Seek help. We'll find a way to bring you the help you need as a community.

For some, who feel content with your life but feel like you're meant for more, without sacrificing your well-being, you have found your home.

For some, who love their life and just want to help out other beings so that we can rise as a unified humanity playing and dacing in harmony across the planet towards progress, balance and stability, then you have a purpose here with us.

We are not an entity.
We simply represent the video game of life.

You can represent the video game of life.
Everyone is the video game of life.

We are just the hands typing the code behind the veil of the source.
We are the multidimensional matrix developers that have shaped the world into what it is today.

A planetary arena where giant fight over their own interest, threatening the well-being of all the people down on Earth so they can feed their already immense egos.

But we are also the game makers, the artist developers who look for the thrill of the emotion an interface sends through the spine of the player.

We are the creative designers and engineers who spend nights crafting pixel-perfect experiences for other human beings to enjoy.

If we are here on this repo, today, it's so we can, together, turn the world into the amazing experience technology can turn it into.

We are here to help human beings, individuals and collectives alike, to rise to their highest potential.

We are here to make tech that counts.

To be the Craftspeople we have always been.
The Architects we have always been.
And the makers of realities we have always been.

Developers of the world, let's unite and turn the world into a game!
This is a free, open-source project.

The way you contribute to the community depends on what you feel like doing.
You could help this repo to become a technology center bridging devices together, or you could join one of our other repos and find how to help.

As we are a capitalism-boosted open source entity, there's also a repo to turn this experience into a network that everybody involved can profit from financially.

This is a bold vision.
We are looking for the visionaries inside of you who want to dare doing what the Internet has been best at so far: making miracles happen.

But enough chit-chat, and let's dive into what we've been building here.
